# Advent of Code

This repo holds my solutions to the (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/2024] for the year 2024.
All solutions are written in C++ using very minimal use of the C standard library, and C++11.

To build the solution for a specific day, run these commands in your terminal (for UNIX-like operating systems):

```console
$ make -j5
$ ./Day1 input.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must download your own specific input files by logging in to the Advent of Code website.

If you are on Windows, run the Visual Studio Developer Console and compile a specific day using MSVC:

```bat
$ cl /EHsc /Fe:Day1.exe Day1.cpp
$ Day1.exe
```
